Note:

  On the Basis Expansion Plot it is hard to see at first but if it appears that the "blue shaded" Basis 1 is missing. 
  If you zoom in to the plot by the green line labeled Basis #3 it is right underneath it and essentially overlaps with the green line.
  So in short, there is not a missing Basis line it is just that the blue and green lines overlap and the Basis lines have same values.
