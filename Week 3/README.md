  # Deep Learning Assignment: MNIST Digit Recognition

## Challenge
Given a MNIST Dataset with 60,000 Images train a Convolutional Neural Network Model
To identify the correct digit with an accuracy above 95.5%

## Breakdown
- Train -> 50,000 Images
- Validate -> 10,000 Images
- Test -> 10,000 Images

## Final Results
Test Accuracy = 0.9861
Test Loss = .0474
